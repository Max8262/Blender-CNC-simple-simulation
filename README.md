# Blender-CNC-simple-simulation
This is a simple CNC machine simulation, using Python and Blender. Note that there is only pure movement only, no crafting.

As you can see, this just movement simulation. You can change the points below. 
points = [ (0, 0, 1), (10, 8, 2), (0, 0, 1.5), (20, 20, 1.23), (20, -10, 1)]
