# Blender-CNC-simple-simulation
This is a simple CNC machine simulation, using Python and Blender. Note that there is only pure movement only, no crafting. As you can see below, this just movement simulation. 
The points are the exact locations of where the machine is going to. It also draws the trail, as shown below.

e.g. points = [ (0, 0, 1), (10, 8, 2), (0, 0, 1.5), (20, 20, 1.23), (20, -10, 1)]
